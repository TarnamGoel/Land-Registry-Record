# Land-Registry-Record

This prototype stores Land Registry Data. This is designed to overcome the issues of the previous models. 

Problems with previous models are:
-> Since it work on distributed ledger technology it creates multiple copy across cloud in form of block and lead to wastage of memory.
-> The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes. Hence the time consumption is also high.
-> Lags in precision specially in constrain of huge record.

Land Registry data needs to be blockchain implemented, inorder to solve following problems:
-> Physical papers are sometimes lost, and the cost and time consumption of getting duplicate document is very high.
-> If the papers get damaged by any reason, the other person can claim his property as his own.
-> Fake registry documents can also be made, to cheat the land holders.

Like we carry our government ID's, marksheets, license etc. in a simple app, that can be accessed anytime we need to access. We must have something like that for land registry data also.
Key points for the same:
* There should be proper portal, so that each and every person can access anytime they want.
* The portal should be easy to use i.e people belonging to non technical background can also access it.
* The land record must be accessed after verifying a particular key, that is shared by the land owner only.

 The RIFT protocol is a multi-layered solution where every block mined contains mini-blocks, which, in turn, contain users’ data. The ILCoin developers say that their block size could total up to 5 GB together with mini-blocks
 According to the project’s team, by solving the first-in, first-out and the bottleneck problems, its RIFT protocol makes the “network size potentially unlimited.”  

Step by Step working:
1) A user requests for a transaction.
2) A block representing transaction is created.
3) The block is broadcasted to all the nodes of the network.
4) All the nodes validate the transaction and the block.
5) The block is added the chain.
6) The transaction gets verified and executed.
